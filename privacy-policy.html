            <b>Information you provide to us</b> We receive and store any
            information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the
            registration process and/or through your account settings, we may
            collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone
            number, etc. If you sign in to the Services through a third party
            site or service, you understand some content and/or information in
            those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be
            transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such
            transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted
            to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, when
            you sign up for an account using Google Calendar we may import the
            contents of your Google Calendar account, including without
            limitation any calendars to which you have access, to your 7th Gear
            Account. Certain information may be required to register with us or
            to take advantage of some of our features. We may communicate with
            you if you’ve provided us with the means to do so. For example, we
            may send you periodic emails. Also, we may receive confirmation when
            you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us communicate
            with you more effectively. If you do not want to receive
            communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking
            on the “unsubscribe” option in our emails or by sending us a message
            at <a href="mailto:support@Nowaat.com">support@Nowaat.com</a>.

            <b>Information Collected Automatically</b> Whenever you interact
            with our Services, we automatically receive and record information
            on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include
            your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie”
            information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to
            access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.
            “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that
            allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and
            when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many
            people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or
            device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but
            this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
            We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you
            might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to
            improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often
            users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that
            knowledge to improve the Services. Some content or applications on
            our Services may be served by third parties, including advertisers,
            promotional partners, content providers and application providers.
            These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web
            beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about
            you when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover
            the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible
            for their privacy policies and practices. If you have any questions
            about an advertisement or other targeted content, we highly
            recommend you to contact the responsible provider directly.
