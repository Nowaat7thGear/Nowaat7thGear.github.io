              <b>Information you provide to us</b> We receive and store any
              information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the
              registration process and/or through your account settings, we may
              collect Personal Information such as your name, email address,
              phone number, etc. If you sign in to the Services through a third
              party site or service, you understand some content and/or
              information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”)
              may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such
              transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information
              transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for
              example, when you sign up for an account using Google Calendar we
              may import the contents of your Google Calendar account, including
              without limitation any calendars to which you have access, to your
              7thGear Account. Certain information may be required to register
              with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may
              communicate with you if you’ve provided us with the means to do
              so. For example, we may send you periodic emails. Also, we may
              receive confirmation when you open an email from us. This
              confirmation helps us communicate with you more effectively. If
              you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate
              your preference by clicking on the “unsubscribe” option in our
              emails or by sending us a message at

              <b>Information Collected Automatically</b> Whenever you interact
              with our Services, we automatically receive and record information
              on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include
              your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie”
              information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to
              access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.
              “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device
              that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how
              and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how
              many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your
              browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of
              cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of
              our features. We may use this data to customize content for you
              that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may
              also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can
              tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services,
              and we can use that knowledge to improve the Services. Some
              content or applications on our Services may be served by third
              parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, content
              providers and application providers. These third parties may use
              cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking
              technologies to collect information about you when you use our
              Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by
              any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy
              policies and practices. If you have any questions about an
              advertisement or other targeted content, we highly recommend you
              to contact the responsible provider directly.
